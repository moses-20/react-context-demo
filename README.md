# React Context Example

This application demonstrates how to use React Context API hooks.

In this example, we provide 2 contexts. One for changing the theme and one for showing a list of books. You can find them defined in the `contexts` folder. You can take the `book context` to mean the single source of truth for providing list of books.

## Getting started
- clone this repository 
- run `npm install` to get the node modules
- and then `npm start` to run the development server

Note that React version is 16.8, if you find problems installing dependencies with Node 14+, it is advisable to create a new React app and then duplicate the code.
